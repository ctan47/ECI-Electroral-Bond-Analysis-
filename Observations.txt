First observations.

1.Surprised (but not shocked) to see lesser known companies who have donated hundreds of crores.

2.Lot of public listed companies in the list

3.Future gaming which is supposedly owned by Mr Santiago who is also known as lottery king. He was already under surveillance by ED for lottery scam

4.MEIL is the second largest donor. No surprises it got the contracts once it donated the money

5.TMC (not INC) is the second largest receiver of electoral bond money (13% of the total amount redeemed) and INC is on third position.

6.Keventer group was planning to invest 700 Crs for setting up food park in West Bengal. It has donated 195 Crs in Apr and May 2019. You can figure out which party the money went.

7.Kitex, a Kerala based garment company that made 57 Crs in net profit for 2023 donated 25 Crs in 2 months in 2023. Why would a company would donate an amount almost equal to half of it's full year profit to a political party.
